# Data Types in python

# what is data? and why do we need many types of it?

"""
data is infomation with context.
30 is just a number but combine with the word "age = 30"
we can understand the context of the value 30 and that's my friends is data.. well almost
the context here is kidda loose but if we had:

        name = John
        last name = Dou
        age = 30

we can see from the context that we have someone names john Dou that his age is 30..
thats what data is all about and we can do almost anything with it!
"""

# in python we have diffrent types of data


# Variables in python are like boxes they can "store" a actuall data value in them

a = "string" # a is a variable that stores a string value
b = 30 # int
c = 30.5 # float
d = True # bool
e = None # NoneType

# we can print the value of a variable by using the print function

print("print the value of a variable by using the print function")
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
print(e)
print("--------------------------done---------------------------")


# we can also print the type of a variable by using the type function

print("print the type of a variable by using the type function")
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))
print("--------------------------done---------------------------")
